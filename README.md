# Snake Game App.

This is a repository for my school project in iOS development.  
I will be making a game using Sprite Kit together with Swift.  
This is strictly for educational purposes and may contain bad code/formating and other inconsistencies.  

None of this is made for profit. The sole purpose of this repo is so that I can learn SpiteKit and Swift.


The idea is to make a classic Snake Clone but with some of my own elements.
